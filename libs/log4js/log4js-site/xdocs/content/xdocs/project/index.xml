      <p>
      	Log4js is currently <em>one</em> JavaScript file and can be modified by any
      	editor. All the environment arount this file is not nessessarily required
      	to continue development, but will support us in having some stable processes
      	in 
      </p>
      <ul>
      	<li>verify sources using jsLint</li>
      	<li>run unit tests to have stable versions using JSUnit</li>
      	<li>regenerate API documetnations from sources using JSDoc</li>
      	<li>generate the fully website for publishing</li>

      <title>Building Project</title>

      <p>Coming from Java development, the <a href="http://ant.apache.org">Apache Ant</a> 
      is used building the project. Ant supports several targets which can be invoked.</p>
      <p>
      To use Ant it is first required to have installed Java<sup>TM</sup> first.
      After that, you can download Ant from the download section of the project pages.
      Please follow the given installation instructions there.
      </p>
